**About us**

The Havana Club International S.A. joint venture was established in November 1993 by the Cuban company Cuba Ron S.A., responsible for rum production, and the French Pernod Ricard Group, with the goal of developing the Havana Club brand internationally via Pernod Ricard’s strong international distribution network. 

Since 1994, Havana Club has been a priority brand for Pernod Ricard, and today it is one of the Group’s top 13 key spirits brands. 

Since 2003, Havana Club International S.A. has also been in charge of the domestic distribution of the Havana Club brand in Cuba, along with key international brands from the Pernod Ricard portfolio. 

In 2007, Havana Club International S.A. inaugurated its new rum distillery in San José to meet the increasing demand for aged rums. Havana Club is the number three international rum brand in the world outside the US and the worldwide leader in super premium and above rums. 

Havana Club ranked twenty-second in the Impact Top 100 and reached 4.6 million cases in 2018. The company is based in Havana and exports to over 120 countries, excluding the US, where Cuban products are banned due to the trade embargo.
